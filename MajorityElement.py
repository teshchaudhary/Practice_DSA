# Efficient Solution
# Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm
# We increase the count if the canditate element is equal to current element
# Otherwise decrease the count
# This works as if we the count decreases it means there are votes for other as well that reduces the chances to win

# We can also infer that if we divide the array into two
# One containing all the elements that cancels the votes
# Other containing that didn't cancel the votes
# We can see that in the first array will have pairs which can cancel each other if the pair is same as well even then it can come for maximum (n/2) times not more than that
