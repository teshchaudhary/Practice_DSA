# -------- Brian Kerningam's Algorithm --------
# In this algorithm we unset the last set bit
# In this we do an AND operation of a number n with n-1
# If there are bits after the first set bit of number these will be either 0 or there will be no bits

# E.g.
# 40: 101000
# 39: 100111
# AND: 100000 = 32

# print(count(10))


# We can do this operation in O(1) time complexity but with an assumption
# Assumption: Our number is of some fixed bits eg 32 bits, 64 bits etc

# Lookup table bases solution

# We will only store (2^7)-1 number i.e. 8 bit numbers in our table

# Lookup Table
table = [0]*256  # 8 bit numbers are from 0-255

# Preprocessing
# It will be done using naive approach
# The table after preprocessing will contain the number of set bits in  each number 0-255


def preprocessing():
    table[0] = 0
    for i in range(256):
        table[i] = (i & 1) + table[i//2]

# 0xff is an 8 bit number with all set bits = 255


# This code is for 32 bit numbers
# We can increase the limit by adding more values in return statement
