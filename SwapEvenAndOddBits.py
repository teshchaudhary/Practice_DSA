# 0x55555555 is a number representing set bits at odd positions
# 5 = 0101 so 0X55555555 has 16 ones, 16 zeros and the ones,zeros take alternate positions.

# 0xAAAAAAAA is a number representing set bits at even positions
# A = 1010 in hex to binary conversion and makes similar pattern

    # One with only even bits
    # One with only odd bits
    eb = n & (0xAAAAAAAA)
